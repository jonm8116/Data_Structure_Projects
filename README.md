## Notes
This was a very long and challenging assignment. It took a little while how to understand how the entire CMS worked together and also get
the validations working (since I am new to regex). 
My custom validations were:
-username is a minimum of 5 characters
-email must be minimum of 7 characters
-state name should only contain letters
-the code for states should only be two characters long
-the code for states should only contain uppercase letters
